#Goal:  we bring feature table and metadata in the correct format:
# Make the rownames of md and column names of the ft to be the same. 
# Filenames and the order of files need to correspond in both tables, as we will match md attributes to the ft. In that way, both md and ft, can easily be filtered.

#storing the files under different names to preserve the original files
new_ft <- ft 
new_md <- md

colnames(new_ft) <- gsub(' Peak area','',colnames(new_ft)) #removing Peak area extensions from the column names of ft
new_md$filename <- gsub(' Peak area','',new_md$filename) #removing Peak area extensions from the filenames in md

new_ft <- new_ft[order(new_ft$`row ID`),,drop=F] #arranging the rows of ft file by  by ascending order of row ID
new_ft <- new_ft[,colSums(is.na(new_ft))<nrow(new_ft)] #removing if any NA columns present in the ft file
new_md <- new_md[,colSums(is.na(new_md))<nrow(new_md)] #removing if any NA columns present in the md file

#remove the (front & tail) spaces, if any present, from all columns of md
new_md <- data.frame(lapply(new_md, trimws, which = "both"))
